      <h1>WordCamp US 2020 Goes Online, Cancels In-Person Event</h1>
      <p>
        WordCamp US 2020 organizers have cancelled the in-person event in favor
        of hosting it as an online-only conference. With more than a million
        confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. today, 63,000+ deaths, and 31
        states set to partially reopen this weekend, the pandemicâ€™s trajectory
        throughout the country has become increasingly uncertain.

        Many statewide stay-at-home orders are expiring tomorrow, despite no
        state having met the federal guidelines for reopening. Some businesses
        are opting to reopen in a limited capacity, but the general populace is
        still wary of returning to their previous way of life. In the state of
        Missouri
